# GymExperiments

Educational project to compare the performance of different deep-reinforcement-learning algorithms in different OpenAI-Gym-environments. 

Currently learning-success is limited in most environments, except in the CartPole-environment, due to only few and very basic algorithms being implemented (only (Vanilla) REINFORCE) (and my poor hardware). 

Next on the list are replay-buffers for off-policy learning and Actor-Critic algorithms (especially A3C or A2C). And many more in the next couple of weeks/month...
